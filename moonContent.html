      <h2>The Moon</h2>
      <p>
        The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and is the fifth largest moon in the Solar System.  
        Its gravitational pull affects tides on Earth.  
        The Moonâ€™s surface is covered with craters, mountains, and ancient lava plains.  
        It has no atmosphere, no water, and no weather like Earth.  
        Humans first visited the Moon in 1969 with Apollo 11.  
        The Moon always shows the same face to Earth.  
        Its phases are caused by the changing positions of the Earth, Moon, and Sun.  
        A lunar day lasts about 29.5 Earth days.  
        Scientists are planning new missions to explore it again.  
        The Moon inspires art, culture, and science all around the world.
