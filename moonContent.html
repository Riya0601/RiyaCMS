      <h2>The Beautiful Moon</h2>
      <p>The Moon is Earth’s only natural satellite and the fifth largest in the solar system.</p>
      <p>It is about 1/4th the size of Earth and has a diameter of 3,474 km.</p>
      <p>The Moon plays a crucial role in stabilizing Earth’s tilt and climate.</p>
      <p>It influences ocean tides with its gravitational pull.</p>
      <p>The surface is covered with craters, mountains, and plains called maria.</p>
      <p>The Moon has no atmosphere, which makes temperatures extreme.</p>
      <p>Humans first landed on the Moon in 1969 during the Apollo 11 mission.</p>
      <p>It has a synchronous rotation, always showing the same face to Earth.</p>
      <p>The Moon goes through phases as it orbits Earth every 29.5 days.</p>
      <p>Future missions plan to establish lunar bases for research.</p>
