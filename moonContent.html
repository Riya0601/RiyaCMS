      <h2>The Moon</h2>
      <p>
        The Moon is Earth’s only natural satellite. It influences tides, 
        stabilizes Earth’s rotation, and has been the focus of exploration for centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its surface is covered with craters, plains, and mountains formed by impacts and volcanic activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite appearing bright, the Moon reflects only a small percentage of sunlight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scientists believe the Moon formed around 4.5 billion years ago from debris after 
        a giant impact with Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Future missions aim to establish permanent bases for exploration and research.
